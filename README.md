## Challenge Statement
**Problem Statement:**  
Develop a real-time content moderation system that analyzes video streams to detect and address unsuitable or restricted content. The system should ensure automated precision while allowing human oversight, complying with international copyright regulations and content standards.

## Solution Overview
Our AI-powered application is designed to:
- Run multiple AI models in real-time for video and image analysis.
- Automatically detect and flag non-compliant content with precise timestamps.
- Identify a wide range of restricted materials, including:
  - **Copyrighted videos**
  - **Logos**
  - **NSFW content**
  - **Copyrighted audio**
- Utilize machine learning and deep learning for accurate detection.
- Support both **local** and **cloud-based** deployment for scalability.

## System Architecture
### **Multi-Model Content Moderation Pipeline:**
1. **Video Input**: Process videos from various sources.
2. **Keyframe Extraction**: PCA-based keyframe selection to reduce redundancy.
3. **Image Analysis**:
   - **YOLO** for object detection (e.g., identifying logos).
   - **Selenium + ResNet** for further classification.
4. **Audio Analysis**:
   - **Whisper** for speech-to-text transcription.
   - **Wav2Vec2** for inappropriate language filtering.
5. **Content Flagging**:
   - Flagged timestamps generated for non-compliant content.
   - Results combined for review and moderation.

## Key Features & Advantages
- **Real-time, multi-model processing** for efficient content moderation.
- **Scalable** architecture to support large-scale platforms.
- **Precise timestamping** for quick review and moderation.
- **Optimized for local and cloud deployment** to ensure flexibility.

## Implementation & Feedback Integration
- Improved **resource optimization** to enable local device execution.
- Modular and scalable **backend architecture**.
- Designed for **easy adaptability** to evolving requirements.
